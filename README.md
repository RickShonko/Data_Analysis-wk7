# 📊 Heart Disease Dataset Analysis

This project is part of a data analysis assignment using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** in Python.  
The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which contains patient health records related to heart disease.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**.
- Perform basic data analysis (summary statistics and group comparisons).
- Create different types of visualizations using **Matplotlib**.
- Interpret insights from data.

---

## 🛠️ Skills Gained
By completing this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in:

### 1. Data Handling with Pandas
- Importing and reading CSV files.
- Exploring datasets with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.
- Checking and handling missing values.
- Grouping and aggregating data for summary insights.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, std).
- Understanding dataset distributions.
- Identifying relationships between variables (e.g., age vs heart rate).

### 3. Data Visualization with Matplotlib
- Creating **line charts** for trend analysis.
- Using **bar charts** for category comparisons.
- Plotting **histograms** to understand data distributions.
- Making **scatter plots** to visualize relationships between variables.
- Customizing plots with titles, axis labels, legends, and colors.

### 4. Practical Problem-Solving
- Translating real-world health data into meaningful visual insights.
- Applying statistical and visual tools to support decision-making.

## 📈 Visualizations Produced
1. **Line Chart**: Age vs Cholesterol levels.  
2. **Bar Chart**: Average cholesterol by sex.  
3. **Histogram**: Distribution of cholesterol values.  
4. **Scatter Plot**: Age vs Max Heart Rate (colored by heart disease status).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `heart_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.  
3. Run all cells to see the outputs.
